This repository implements the whole [DECODEproject](https://decodeproject.eu)'s Petition Pilot over the [Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/) blockchain distributed by the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) consortium.

To facilitate the creation of transaction families based on [Zenroom VM](https://zenroom.dyne.org) and the [Zencode human-friendly language for smart-contracts](https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker), this TP uses the [Sawtooth SDK](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/sdks.html) in Python and the [zenroom-py](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom-py) bindings.

## üêù API server

To run the http server locally, you need an ASGI server like 
[hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/) or [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).

Also a python virtual environment with all the library dependencies is needed,
follow the following instruction to set it up:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
this creates a virtual environment inside the `venv` folder

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
this activate the virtual environment you'll see a prefix `(venv)` on your PS1 prompt.
From now on the libraries you install goes into that folder and are not system
wide and doesn't mess up things.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

This upgrades the `pip` (package installer for python) to the latest version,
and installs all the python dependencies for the `petition-tp-python` package.


```bash
pip install fastapi[all]
pip install hypercorn
```
This install the ASGI server into your virtual environment and 
the other needed dependencies to run the server

```bash
hypercorn src.tp.server.main:app
```
This runs the server on the `8000` port.

To see the OpenAPI (former SwaggerUI) head to http://localhost:8000/docs

### ENV
to run the middleware some variable environment are needed, or you can use a
dotenv (a file called `.env` in the root of the project) with the following
content:

```bash
export JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
export JWT_TOKEN_SUBJECT=access
export JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
export JWT_USERNAME=demo
export JWT_PASSWORD=demo
export JWT_RANDOM_SECRET=change_me_with_a_very_long_hex_string
```

**the username and paswword are the ones used within the OpenAPI ui**

***
## üê≥ Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To run a transaction

```bash
docker exec -it petition-tp petition --help
```

shows you all the commands available of the little `petition` CLI interface
